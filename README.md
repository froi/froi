# Hi I'm Froi

Current GitHubber and a Code.gov & USDS Alumni. For the past seven years I've been heavily involved with civic and gov. tech both in Puerto Rico and Washington DC.

Primarily a backend engineer, I love me some Python and Javascript. Go has also become a nice go to language which I'm still learning and bashing my head against.

I'm the current lead of [@Code4PuertoRico](https://github.com/Code4PuertoRico) and also one of the founders of [Fullstack Nights](https://fullstacknights.com/), a meetup in Puerto Rico that brings together the developer and design communities.

As a hobby I stream live coding session on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/froidotdev) and produce the [FSN podcast](https://fullstacknights.com/).
